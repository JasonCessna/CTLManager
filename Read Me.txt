_______ Per Season
Provide link for google sheets:
-Weekly Matchups (same format as Season 17. Will have to revise code as is if different team #s are a thing for next season, would have to format it for different formats based on # of teams so this can be run without changing code in the future)
-Team Roster (each team will have a link for the google sheet)
-Season Standings / History (this is where the generated code for TL and Wiki will be posted, still hammering out the details on how this will work or if it will exist at all)
